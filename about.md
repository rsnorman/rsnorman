Ryan Norman has been building web applications for 10+ years for anyone willing
to hire a developer who never reads his email. He has been mostly in health
related industry but isn't afraid to dabble elsewhere.

This site was started for the sole purpose of recording his failures as a technical
lead and helping others avoid the same mistakes. Also to show his friends and
family that he really does build websites (and not just ones behind paywalls or
on intranets).
