Well, here I am, through all my hard work, perseverance, and ingenuity I've been
moved into a lead position on a team at my company. Ha, just kidding, developers
quit, others moved to different teams, one turned to the dark side and is in
management; I came to this role like most, just right place, right time.

And no one else wanted to deal with the *headaches*.

I kid (kinda) and all snarkiness aside, I'm honored, excited and honestly scared
to have the responsibility of keeping our codebase clean, offering advice and
training to junior developers, and most importantly helping the team to run
smoothly. I'm anticipating some sleepless nights as deadlines loom, that one
friggin' flakey feature test won't pass, or trying to take the brunt of client
demands so the rest of the team can do **The Important Work**.

With the *touchy-feely-clich√©-new-blog* statement out of the way, let's get to why
I really want to put myself through the pain of writing posts once a week (maybe
every two, we'll see).

First thing, I'm going to try and avoid posting code snippets only to show
something cool or to get you to think, ["check out the big brain on Brett!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hWZM8UicVI)
There are way better developers already doing that who are much more in touch with the
pulse of new coding developments. Go read their stuff and be better for it. What
I want to focus on are topics about how our team is succeeding an agile environment.

Don't worry, there will still be plenty of `code`. It'll just be in support of
work that lets us make less mistakes, speeds up developer domain knowledge, and most
importantly, move quicker as a cohesive unit.

And, even if I ended up bombing completely as a technical lead, I'll at least
have a record for when everything went off the rails (pun totally intended).

I'm obviously hoping this won't be the case.
