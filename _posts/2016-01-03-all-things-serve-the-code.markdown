Well, here I am; moved into a lead position on a team. Obviously earned through hard work and perseverance.
Ha, just kidding, developers quit, others moved to different teams, one is now my manager;
I came to this role like most, just right place, right time.

And no one else wanted to deal with the headaches.

I kid (kinda) but all snarkiness aside, I'm honored, excited and honestly scared to have the responsibility
of keeping our codebase clean, offering advice and training to junior developers, and
most importantly helping the team to run smoothly. I'm anticipating some sleepless
nights as deadlines loom, that one friggin' flakey feature test won't pass, or
trying to take the brunt of client demands so the rest of the team can do the
**important** work.

With the *touchy-feely-clich√©-new-blog* statement out of the way, let's get to why
I really want to put myself through the pain of writing posts once a week (maybe every two, we'll see).
First thing, I'm going to try and avoid just posting code snippets just to show something cool or how
smart I am. There are way better developers already doing that who are much more in touch with the
pulse of new coding developments. Go read their stuff and be better for it. What I want to focus
on is code and practices that can help others become better technical leads. That or have a record
so I can see when everything went off the tracks.

I'm hoping for the former.
